Please view the site deployed site on [GitHub Pages.](http://levantrieu.github.io/RED-project-mars-quiz)

**Project Brief**

This is a quiz app where a user answers 3 questions for a chance to go to Mars. It is built using the React framework.

**Tools and Methods Used**

- React
- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Responsive design (mobile and desktop)
- Gulp, Webpack, React Router, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync
- Git and GitHub

**Personal Summary**

In the short time that I learned React and applying it to this project, I can see how powerful it is as a framework to build large scale apps. By breaking down an app's interface into self-contained functional components, React allows developers to scale up without worrying about breaking the app.
