# React Quiz App Project

Please view the site deployed site on [Firebase.](https://mars-quiz.firebaseapp.com)

**Project Brief**

This is a single page quiz app where a user answers 3 questions for a chance to go to Mars. It is built using the React framework. I built 4 main components for displaying the quiz. Each component is a self-contained piece that will allow to easy changes in the future.

**Tools and Methods Used**

- React
- HTML/CSS
- Flexbox
- Responsive design (mobile and desktop)
- Gulp, Webpack, React Router, SASS, Autoprefixer, Browser-Sync
- Git and GitHub

**Personal Summary**

In the short time that I learned React and applying it to this project, I can see how powerful it is as a framework to build large scale apps. By breaking down an app's interface into self-contained functional components, React allows developers to scale up without worrying about breaking the app.
